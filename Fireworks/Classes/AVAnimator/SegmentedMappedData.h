// A segmented mapped data object extends NSData so that the lifetime of a set
// of mapped file segments can be managed as a group of objects. If the container
// SegmentedMappedData is deallocated, then each segmented mapping it contains
// it deallocated assuming there are no other active references.
//
// Unlike a plain mapped file, a SegmentedMappedData will put off creating
// a specific mapping until the data for a specific segment is needed.
// The segment objets support and explicit mapSegment/unmapSegment API
// that is used to map the segment into memory before use of the data.
